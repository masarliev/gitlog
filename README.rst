Configuration
*************

See *gitlog/settings.py* for available settings.

Users and repositories are managed from post-receive hook. User is created only if it starts with '@'. Example

[group username]

members = user@home user@office


[group repositories]

members = @username

writable = repo1

readonly = repo2


In this case after gitosis-admin push 1 user will be created with username "username" and 2 repositories (repo1, repo2)

Additional and necessary settings

[repo repo1]

owner = username

[repo repo2]

owner = otheruser

[user username]

email = user@email

password = secret
